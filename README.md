# Flutter News App
The full source code for the Flutter News App created at the Assembly session on 27th July 2019

IMP: Please follow the steps to configure Google services (sign in + Firebase) - and copy the resulting google-services.json to android/app folder - without that file this app won't work.

Acknowledgement: Adapted from a project created a few years ago by Ankur Kedia on the GeekyAnts blog.
